# Conway's Game of Life with OpenCL

High-performance implementation of Conway's Game of Life using both OpenCL and scalar (CPU) approaches. This project demonstrates advanced parallel computing techniques, efficient memory management, and robust simulation strategies.

## Requirements

- **CMake** (version 3.15 or later)
- **OpenCL SDK** (NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel)
- **C++17 Compiler** (MinGW-w64 or equivalent for Windows)
- **Windows build tools** (MSYS2 recommended) or Linux/WSL

## Directory Structure

- **include/**: Header files (e.g., `GameOfLife.h`, `CLI.h`)
- **src/**: Source code files (e.g., `GameOfLife.cpp`, `CLI.cpp`, `main.cpp`, `performance_measure.cpp`)
- **build/**: Build directory (generated by CMake)

## Build

Open a terminal and navigate to the project root. Then, create a build directory and run CMake:

```powershell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target game_of_life performance_measure
```

### This will build the following executables:

- **game_of_life.exe** – The interactive CLI version with integrated OpenCL support
- **performance_measure.exe** – The performance measurement tool

## Running the Project

From the build folder, run:

### CLI Version

```powershell
./game_of_life.exe
```

The CLI supports the following commands:

- **create**: Create a new world (prompts for width and height)
- **load**: Load a world from a file (prompts for filename)
- **save**: Save the current world to a file (prompts for filename)
- **run \<mode\> \<n\>**: Run the simulation for n generations
  - **scalar**: CPU-based evolution
  - **opencl**: OpenCL (GPU/CPU-based) evolution
- **set**: Set the state of a cell (prompts for coordinates and state)
- **get**: Get the state of a cell (prompts for coordinates)
- **glider**: Insert a "Glider" pattern at a specified position
- **toad**: Insert a "Toad" pattern at a specified position
- **beacon**: Insert a "Beacon" pattern at a specified position
- **methuselah**: Insert a Methuselah pattern at a specified position
- **print on/off**: Enable or disable printing after each generation
- **delay \<ms\>**: Set the delay (in milliseconds) for simulation
- **help**: Display this help message
- **exit / quit**: Exit the program

### Performance Measurement

```powershell
./performance_measure.exe
```

This executable runs simulations on various grid sizes using OpenCL, outputs a CSV file (simulation_results.csv), and can be used to generate performance plots.

## Technical Details

- **Toroidal Grid**: The grid wraps around at the edges, ensuring that every cell always has eight neighbors.
- **Double Buffering**: Two separate buffers are used to store the current and next generation of cell states.
- **OpenCL Integration**: The OpenCL kernel is directly integrated into the main application, eliminating the need for external process calls.
- **OpenCL Parallelization**: Each work-item computes the next state of a single cell, allowing for significant acceleration on parallel hardware.
- **Memory Management**: STL containers (e.g., std::vector) manage memory safely and efficiently, leveraging RAII principles.

## Input Format Flexibility

The application supports flexible input formats for coordinates:

- Standard format: `x,y`
- With parentheses: `(x,y)`
- With spaces: `x y`
